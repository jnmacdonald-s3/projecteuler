projectEuler.py

NOTE: This README is a working draft

Running the program with the verbose option is reccommended
e.g.:  ./projectEuler.py -v

This is because problem #10 uses a brute force isPrime function
which is slow. The verbose option shows a percentage complete
update during the problem so you know your computer didn't crash
